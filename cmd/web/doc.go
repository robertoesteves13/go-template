/// This directory should have all the code responsible for the web application.
/// You shouldn't write any domain logic here, but rather write in the root
/// module. Keep in mind that all code written here serves as a baseline to
/// start your application, so feel free to extend it to your needs.

/// There's also a bun project initialized here. This is for the frontend and it
/// defaults to using sass, picocss, htmx and alpine, but you can also bring
/// your own libraries. The commands to build the bundle can be found in the
/// Makefile. The compiled bundle is managed in `assets.go`, where it embeds
/// into the binary and compresses on startup so it can save bandwith.

/// Also if you feel you made something that could benefit everyone, feel free
/// to submit an PR!
